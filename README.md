Topic : Outpatient Management System

Sri Lanka is recognized as a country that offers one of the most privileged health services in
South Asia. Both publicly and privately managed hospitals are providing excellent inimitable
services in terms of medical aspects. Even though both the public and private sectors offer
unmatched services, the public sector is getting neglected by society due to the lack of
management strategies. 

The public is falling behind to get the most out of the provided
services as government hospitals are not well integrated with health information systems,
hence the medical records and everything is recorded on paper-based forms.

When we address the above problem, the lack of a proper outpatient management system can
be identified. 
Some of the common problems the public is facing include long waiting queues
and miscommunications between appointments and health record management.

As a solution, you have to develop an outpatient management system for Sri Lankan public
healthcare hospitals to overcome the issues described above.
